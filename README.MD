STUDENTS HIRING STUDENTS

This project is visualize the in and outs of the student hiring process led by students of ArtSci Lab at University of Texas. 
The main object is to analyze the process and final decision of selecting a candidate. 

The breakdown on the interview:

Dashboard 1 - The analysis starts from visualizing the candidates in each step of the process and the breakdown of the applicants by each round, school, student year and college major.

Dashboard 2 - It gives a clear picture of the analytics and web developer challange visulaizing the submissions received by the applicants and the shortlisted applicants. Also, it shows which scripting languages and databases were popular among the submissions.

Dashboard 3 - It gives a clear understanding of the interview round by visualizing the marks assigned by each interviwer and marks assigned by round type.

Takeaways:
1. Out of 274 applicants, 266 are masters students from 2 schools only leaving 0 applicants from the other schools. Thereby, I believe that in order to overcome this, employers must begin developing more effective strategies for contacting all students on campus in order to recruit the potential applicant.
2. â€‹62% of the applicants are not fully qualified i.e., not submitting all the required documents. As a result, we can conclude that the job candidates really haven't read the job description in its full length rather than applying to jobs at random, possibly in the hope of landing a position. As a consequence, employer must make sure applicants will not be able to submit their application unless they attach the necessary documents for each job posted on Handshake.
3. Out of the 6 final candidates, 4 were able to answer the behavioural question better than the technical, so the interviewer must check the level of difficulty being easy for behavioural question and hard for technical questions or the candidates are really weak on the technical note.
